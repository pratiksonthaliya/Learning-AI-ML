# Lesson 5 - Comparing data in Python



```python
from helper_functions import print_llm_response, get_llm_response
```

Take a closer look at the True/False variable you saw at the end of the last lesson.


```python
food_preferences_tommy = {
    #"dietary_restrictions": "vegetarian",
    "favorite_ingredients": ["mushrooms", "olives"],
    "experience_level": "intermediate",
    "maximum_spice_level": 6
}
```

You added the element `"is vegetarian"` with a value equal to `True`


```python
food_preferences_tommy["is_vegetarian"] = True
```

This type of data is know as booleans. It can take only two values: `True` or `False`.


```python
print(food_preferences_tommy)
```

## True and False

`True` and `False` may look like strings without quotation marks. They are the two values that booleans can take. 


```python
print(True)
print(False)
```

Below, you can check the type for each of these values.


```python
type(True)
```


```python
type(False)
```

</p>  


As with any other data type, you can assign booleans to variables:


```python
is_tommy_my_friend = True
```


```python
is_isabel_older_than_me = False
```


```python
print(is_tommy_my_friend)
```


```python
print(is_isabel_older_than_me)
```


```python
type(is_isabel_older_than_me)
```

### Comparison Operators

Booleans are what you get back when you compare variables in python. For example, here are the ages for Isabel, Daniel and Tommy:


```python
isabel_age = 28
daniel_age = 30
tommy_age = 30
```

In Python you can compare values using the same operator you probably encounter in math classes. Let's start determining if Isabel is older than Daniel using `>`.


```python
print(isabel_age > daniel_age)     
```

Now, let's determine if she is younger using `<`:


```python
print(isabel_age < daniel_age) 
```


```python
is_isabel_older_than_daniel = isabel_age > daniel_age
print(is_isabel_older_than_daniel)
```

You can also use `<=` and `>=` to check if one number is greater than or equal to the other, or if it is lower than or equal to the other. 


```python
print(isabel_age <= daniel_age)
```

Since Daniel and Tommy are the same age, when you use `<=` and `>=` you will get `True` for both cases:


```python
print(tommy_age < daniel_age)
```


```python
print(tommy_age <= daniel_age)
```

### Equality Operator
So, what if you want to check if to things are equal? You would neeed to use `==`. 

- `= `is an assignment operator, it assigns values to variables
- `==` is a comparison operator, it checks if two things are holding the same value, or if two pieces of data are equal 

So, going back to comparing Daniel's and Tommy's age:


```python
print(tommy_age == daniel_age)
```

And Isabel's and Daniel's:


```python
print(isabel_age == daniel_age) 
```

This operator works for strings too. Here you have definitive proof that a vegetarian is not the same as a vegan.


```python
#strings
print("vegetarian" == "vegan")
```

### Logical Operators

Operations with booleans involve logical operators like `and` and `or`. Let's define a couple of boolean variables:


```python
is_tommy_my_friend = True
is_isabel_my_friend = True
```

If you want to check whether both Tommy and Isabel are your friends, you can use the `and` operator:


```python
print(is_tommy_my_friend and is_isabel_my_friend)
```

If you want to check whether at least one of them is your friend, you can use the `or` operator:


```python
print(is_tommy_my_friend or is_isabel_my_friend)
```

Let's say that Isabel, Tommy and Daniel are playing a game involving their ages:


```python
isabel_age = 28
daniel_age = 30
otto_age = 29
```

The game involves checking whether Isabel is younger than both Tommy and Daniel:


```python
is_isabel_younger_than_tommy = isabel_age < tommy_age
is_isabel_younger_than_daniel = isabel_age < daniel_age
```


```python
print(is_isabel_younger_than_tommy and is_isabel_younger_than_daniel)
```

In the next video, you will use booleans to write programs that execute different lines of code depending on the boolean value.

## Extra practice

Please go through the exercises in the cells below if you want some extra practice for the topics you covered in this lesson.


```python
# Check whether Isabel is older
# than at least one of my friends (Tommy and Daniel)

### EDIT THE FOLLOWING CODE ###
# Hint: Replace the "?" with the correct comparison operator
is_isabel_older_than_tommy = isabel_age ? tommy_age
is_isabel_older_than_daniel = isabel_age ? daniel_age
### --------------- ###

### EDIT THE FOLLOWING CODE ###
#Hint: Recall the logical operators "and" and "or" 
print("Check if Isabel is older than at least one of my friends")
### --------------- ###
```
